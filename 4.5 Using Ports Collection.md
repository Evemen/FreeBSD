# Using Ports Collection

The Ports Collection is a set of Makefiles, patches, and description files. Each set of these files is used to compile and install an individual application on FreeBSD, and is called a port.

By default, the Ports Collection itself is stored as a subdirectory of /usr/ports.

Before an application can be compiled using a port, the Ports Collection must first be installed.  If it was not installed during the installation of FreeBSD, use one of the following methods to install it:

Portsnap Method
```
portsnap fetch
portsnap extract
portsnap fetch update
```

Subversion Method
```
pkg install subversion
svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/ports/head /usr/ports
svn update /usr/ports
```

The Ports Collection contains directories for software categories. Inside each category are subdirectories for individual applications. Each application subdirectory contains a set of files that tells FreeBSD how to compile and install that program, called a ports skeleton. Each port skeleton includes these files and directories:
Makefile, distinfo, files/, pkg-descr, pkg-plist.

## Installing Ports

Before compiling any port, be sure to update the Ports Collection as described in the previous section. Since the installation of any third-party software can introduce security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to first check https://vuxml.freebsd.org/ for known security issues related to the port. Alternately, run pkg audit -F before installing a new port. This command can be configured to automatically perform a security audit and an update of the vulnerability database during the daily security system check. For more information, refer to pkg-audit(8) and periodic(8).

```
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
make install
make clean
# During installation, a working subdirectory is created which contains all the temporary files used during compilation. Removing this directory saves disk space and minimizes the chance of problems later when upgrading to the newer version of the port:
```

## Removing Ports

Installed ports can be uninstalled using pkg delete.

Alternately, make deinstall can be run in the port's directory:

```
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
make deinstall
```

## Upgrading Ports

Before attempting an upgrade, read /usr/ports/UPDATING from the top of the file to the date closest to the last time ports were upgraded or the system was installed.

list the installed ports which are out of date: `pkg version -l "<"`
