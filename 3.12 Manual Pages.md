# Manual Pages

Manual pages are divided into sections which represent the type of topic. In FreeBSD, the following sections are available:

    1. User commands.

    2. System calls and error numbers.

    3. Functions in the C libraries.

    4. Device drivers.

    5. File formats.

    6. Games and other diversions.

    7. Miscellaneous information.

    8. System maintenance and operation commands.

    9. System kernel interfaces.

In some cases, the same topic may appear in more than one section of the online manual. For example, there is a chmod user command and a chmod() system call. To tell man(1) which section to display, specify the section number:

`man 1 chmod`

If the name of the manual page is unknown, use man -k to search for keywords in the manual page descriptions:

`man -k mail`

This command displays a list of commands that have the keyword “mail” in their descriptions.

## GNU Info Files

FreeBSD includes several applications and utilities produced by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In addition to manual pages, these programs may include hypertext documents called info files. These can be viewed using info(1) or, if editors/emacs is installed, the info mode of emacs.
