# Directory Structure

The FreeBSD directory hierarchy is fundamental to obtaining an overall understanding of the system.

A mount point is a directory where additional file systems can be grafted onto a parent file system (usually the root file system).

These directories are usually referenced to entries in /etc/fstab. This file is a table of various file systems and mount points and is read by the system.

A complete description of the file system hierarchy is available in hier(7).
