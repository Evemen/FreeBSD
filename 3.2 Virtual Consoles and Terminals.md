# [Virtual Consoles and Terminals](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/consoles.html)

## Virtual Consoles

The key combinations Alt+F1 through Alt+F8 have been reserved by FreeBSD for switching between virtual consoles.

Use Alt+F1 to switch to the system console (ttyv0), Alt+F2 to access the first virtual console (ttyv1), Alt+F3 to access the second virtual console (ttyv2), and so on.

In FreeBSD, the number of available virtual consoles is configured in this section of /etc/ttys:

To disable a virtual console, put a comment symbol (#) at the beginning of the line representing that virtual console.

Do not comment out the line for the system console ttyv0. Note that the last virtual console (ttyv8) is used to access the graphical environment if Xorg has been installed and configured.

## Single User Mode
The FreeBSD boot menu provides an option labelled as “Boot Single User”.

This mode is typically used to repair a system that will not boot or to reset the root password when it is not known.

While in single user mode, networking and other virtual consoles are not available. However, full root access to the system is available, and by default, the root password is not needed. For these reasons, physical access to the keyboard is needed to boot into this mode and determining who has physical access to the keyboard is something to consider when securing a FreeBSD system.

The settings which control single user mode are found in this section of /etc/ttys:
