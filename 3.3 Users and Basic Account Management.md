# Users and Basic Account Management

This chapter describes:

- The different types of user accounts on a FreeBSD system.
- How to add, remove, and modify user accounts.
- How to set limits to control the resources that users and groups are allowed to access.
- How to create groups and add users as members of a group.

## 1. Account Types

Since all access to the FreeBSD system is achieved using accounts and all processes are run by users, user and account management is important.

There are three main types of accounts: system accounts, user accounts, and the superuser account.

### System Accounts

Examples of system accounts are daemon, operator, bind, news, and www.

### User Accounts

### The Superuser Account

The superuser account, usually called root, is used to manage the system with no limitations on privileges.

While one can log in as root, this is highly discouraged.

Instead, use su to become the superuser. If - is specified when running this command, the user will also inherit the root user's environment. The user running this command must be in the wheel group or else the command will fail. The user must also know the password for the root user account.


Example 3.1. Install a Program As the Superuser
```
% configure
% make
% su -
Password:
# make install
# exit
%
```

The built-in su(1) framework works well for single systems or small networks with just one system administrator. An alternative is to install the security/sudo package or port. This software provides activity logging and allows the administrator to configure which users can run which commands as the superuser.

## 2. Managing Accounts

```
adduser
# In this example, the user has been invited into the wheel group, allowing them to become the superuser with su(1).
chpass chloe
# Any user can use chpass(1) to change their default shell and personal information associated with their user account. The superuser can use this utility to change additional account information for any user.
rmuser chloe
# rmuser(8) cannot be used to remove superuser accounts since that is almost always an indication of massive destruction.
passwd chloe
# Any user can easily change their password using passwd(1).
# The superuser can change any user's password by specifying the username when running passwd(1). When this utility is run as the superuser, it will not prompt for the user's current password. This allows the password to be changed when a user cannot remember the original password.
pw #  pw(8) has a very powerful set of command line options that make it suitable for use in shell scripts
```

## 3. Managing Groups

A group is a list of users. A group is identified by its group name and GID. In FreeBSD, the kernel uses the UID of a process, and the list of groups it belongs to, to determine what the process is allowed to do. Most of the time, the GID of a user or process usually means the first group in the list.

The group name to GID mapping is listed in /etc/group.
