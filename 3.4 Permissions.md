# Permissions

In FreeBSD, every file and directory has an associated set of permissions and several utilities are available for viewing and modifying these permissions.

Use the -l argument to ls(1) to view a long directory listing that includes a column of information about a file's permissions for the owner, group, and everyone else.

## The *setuid*, *setgid*, and *sticky* permissions

These settings are important for some UNIXÂ® operations as they provide functionality not normally granted to normal users. To understand them, the difference between the real user ID and effective user ID must be noted.

The real user ID is the UID who owns or starts the process. The effective UID is the user ID the process runs as.

The setuid permission may be set by prefixing a permission set with the number four (4) as shown in the following example:

```
# chmod 4755 suidexample.sh
# ls -l
-rwsr-xr-x   1 trhodes  trhodes    63 Aug 29 06:36 suidexample.sh
```

Note that a s is now part of the permission set designated for the file owner, replacing the executable bit. This allows utilities which need elevated permissions, such as passwd(1).

To set the setgid permission on a file, provide chmod(1) with a leading two (2):
```
# chmod 2755 sgidexample.sh
-rwxr-sr-x   1 trhodes  trhodes    44 Aug 31 01:49 sgidexample.sh
```

The setuid and setgid permission bits may lower system security, by allowing for elevated permissions. The third special permission, the sticky bit, can strengthen the security of a system.

When the sticky bit is set on a directory, it allows file deletion only by the file owner. This is useful to prevent file deletion in public directories, such as /tmp, by users who do not own the file. To utilize this permission, prefix the permission set with a one (1):


```
# chmod 1777 /tmp
# ls -al / | grep tmp
drwxrwxrwt  10 root  wheel         512 Aug 31 01:49 tmp
```

The sticky bit permission will display as a t at the very end of the permission set:
