# Processes and Daemons

FreeBSD is a multi-tasking operating system. Each program running at any one time is called a process. Every running command starts at least one new process and there are a number of system processes that are run by FreeBSD.

The term daemon comes from Greek mythology and represents an entity that is neither good nor evil, and which invisibly performs useful tasks. This is why the BSD mascot is the cheerful-looking daemon with sneakers and a pitchfork.

## Viewing Processes
```
ps # To display a static list of the currently running processes
top # To display all the running processes and update the display every few seconds in order to interactively see what the computer is doing
```

## Killing Processes
Two signals can be used to stop a process: SIGTERM and SIGKILL.

One way to communicate with any running process or daemon is to send a signal using kill(1).

```
pgrep -l getty
su
/bin/kill -s hup pid-num
```
