# Using pkg for Binary Package Management

## Getting Started with pkg
pkg only works with binary packages, FreeBSD includes a bootstrap utility which can be used to download and install pkg and its manual pages.

To bootstrap the system, run: `/usr/sbin/pkg`.

Each pkg command argument is documented in a command-specific manual page. To read the manual page for pkg install, for example, run either of these commands:

```
pkg help install
man pkg-install
```

## Obtaining Information About Installed Packages

```
pkg info
pkg info pkg
```

## Installing and Removing Packages

```
pkg install packagename
pkg install curl
pkg info
pkg delete curl
pkg autoremove
```

## Upgrading Installed Packages

```
pkg upgrade
```

## Auditing Installed Packages

Software vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in third-party applications. To address this, pkg includes a built-in auditing mechanism. To determine if there are any known vulnerabilities for the software installed on the system, run:

```
pkg audit -F
```

## Automatically Removing Unused Packages

Removing a package may leave behind dependencies which are no longer required. Unneeded packages that were installed as dependencies (leaf packages) can be automatically detected and removed using:

```
pkg autoremove
```

Packages installed as dependencies are called automatic packages. Non-automatic packages, i.e the packages that were explicity installed not as a dependency to another package, can be listed using:

```
pkg prime-list
pkg prime-origins
```

Marking an installed package as automatic can be done using:
`# pkg set -A 1 devel/cmake`

Once a package is a leaf package and is marked as automatic, it gets selected by pkg autoremove.

Marking an installed package as not automatic can be done using:

`pkg set -A 0 devel/cmake` 

## Restoring the Package Database

pkg includes its own package database backup mechanism. This functionality is enabled by default.

To restore the contents of a previous package database backup, run the following command replacing /path/to/pkg.sql with the location of the backup:

```
pkg backup -r /path/to/pkg.sql
```

To run a manual backup of the pkg database, run the following command, replacing /path/to/pkg.sql with a suitable file name and location:

```
pkg backup -d /path/to/pkg.sql
```

## Removing Stale Packages

By default, pkg stores binary packages in a cache directory defined by PKG_CACHEDIR in pkg.conf(5). Only copies of the latest installed packages are kept. Older versions of pkg kept all previous packages. To remove these outdated binary packages, run:

```
pkg clean
```

The entire cache may be cleared by running:

```
pkg clean -a
```
