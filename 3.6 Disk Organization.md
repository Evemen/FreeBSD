# Disk Organization
The smallest unit of organization that FreeBSD uses to find files is the filename.

Filenames are case-sensitive.

FreeBSD does not use the extension of a file to determine whether the file is a program, document, or some other form of data.

Files are stored in directories.

Directories and files are stored in a file system. Each file system contains exactly one directory at the very top level, called the root directory for that file system.  One file system is designated the root file system or /. Every other file system is mounted under the root file system.

File systems are contained in partitions.  This does not have the same meaning as the common usage of the term partition (for example, MS-DOS® partition), because of FreeBSD's UNIX® heritage. Each partition is identified by a letter from a through to h.

FreeBSD also uses disk space for swap space to provide virtual memory.

Disks in FreeBSD are divided into slices, referred to in Windows® as partitions, which are numbered from 1 to 4. These are then divided into partitions, which contain file systems, and are labeled using letters.
