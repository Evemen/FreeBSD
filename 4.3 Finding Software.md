# Finding Software

The FreeBSD web site maintains an up-to-date searchable list of all the available applications, at https://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html

```
pkg search package # To search the binary package repository for an application
pkg search -o package # list the origin of each package
```

To query the local version of the ports tree
```
whereis lsof # locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
# lsof: /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
```
