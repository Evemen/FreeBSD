# Shells

A shell provides a command line interface for interacting with the operating system.

FreeBSD comes with several shells, including the Bourne shell (sh(1)) and the extended C shell (tcsh(1)). Other shells are available from the FreeBSD Ports Collection, such as zsh and bash.

The shell that is used is really a matter of taste. A C programmer might feel more comfortable with a C-like shell such as tcsh(1). A Linux® user might prefer bash. Each shell has unique properties that may or may not work with a user's preferred working environment, which is why there is a choice of which shell to use.

One common shell feature is filename completion.

Another feature of the shell is the use of environment variables. Note that the names of environment variables are always in uppercase.

```
echo $SHELL $EDITOR
```

## Changing the Shell
The easiest way to permanently change the default shell is to use chsh.

The new shell must be present in /etc/shells.

## Advanced Shell Techniques

Shell redirection

```
 ls > directory_listing.txt
 sort < directory_listing.txt > sorted.txt
 ```

In all of the previous examples, the commands are performing redirection using file descriptors. Every UNIX® system has file descriptors, which include standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr). Each one has a purpose, where input could be a keyboard or a mouse, something that provides input. Output could be a screen or paper in a printer. And error would be anything that is used for diagnostic or error messages. All three are considered I/O based file descriptors and sometimes considered streams.

Another method of redirection is the pipe operator.

The UNIX® pipe operator, “|” allows the output of one command to be directly passed or directed to another program.

`cat directory_listing.txt | sort | less`
